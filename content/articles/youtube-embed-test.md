# YouTube Embed Test

This article demonstrates how to embed YouTube videos in your Markdown content. Simply paste a YouTube link on its own line, and it will automatically be converted to an embedded player.

## Standard YouTube Link

Here's a standard YouTube video link that should be converted to an embedded player:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

## YouTube Short Link

You can also use the shortened YouTube URL format:

https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ

## YouTube Shorts

YouTube Shorts links are also supported:

## Link with Text

You can also [link text to a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) and it will be converted to an embedded player.

## Multiple Videos

You can include multiple videos in your article:

## Regular Links

Regular links will still work as expected:

[Google](https://www.google.com)

## How It Works

The system uses a custom component with ReactMarkdown to detect YouTube URLs and convert them to embedded players. This works with:

1. Standard YouTube URLs (youtube.com/watch?v=...)
2. Short YouTube URLs (youtu.be/...)
3. YouTube Shorts URLs (youtube.com/shorts/...)

## Conclusion

Using this approach, you can easily embed YouTube videos in your articles without having to write any HTML or iframe code. Just paste the YouTube URL, and the system will handle the rest!
